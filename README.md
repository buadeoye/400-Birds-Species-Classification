## Aim of this Project
- This project aims to predict revenue for a set of customers for a time period in the future.
- Different machine learning & deep learning techniques were used.
- *Deployment* was done using *Flask API on an AWS EC2 instance*.

## Datasets:-
- Source :arrow_right: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species)

## :memo: Best Model
- VGG19 with fne tuning of last few layers by freezing first 17 layers resulted in lowest loss of 0.14 on completely unseen test images.

## Deployment using Flask API
- A simple web-app has been built using this model (as shown in the Demo).
- This web-app has also been ***Deployed using Flask API***.
- Using this web-app, you can upload an image of a bird and the web-app will return the species name in the UI.
